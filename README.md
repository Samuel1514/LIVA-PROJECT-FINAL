- **MongoDB**: For database management (you can use MongoDB Atlas or set up MongoDB locally).

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the repository**:
   First, clone the project repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LIVA-PROJECT-FINAL.git

2.**Set up the Python environment**:
 Create a virtual environment:
 ```bash

On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Install required Python packages: After activating the virtual environment, install the necessary dependencies by running the following commands:
pip install flask flask-cors google-generativeai requests
Freeze the installed dependencies: Generate a requirements.txt file for future use:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
Set the Flask app environment variable:
On macOS/Linux:
export FLASK_APP=app.py
On Windows:
set FLASK_APP=app.py
Run the Flask application: Start the Flask application to begin the avatar interaction and caregiving system:
python app.py
For MongoDB database: If you are using a Node.js application for the database, make sure you have MongoDB set up, and install Node.js dependencies:
npm install
Then, run the Node.js server:

node app.js
Additional Required Packages for Node.js:
